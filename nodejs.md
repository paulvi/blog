Very interesting discussion [Is it a good architectural decision to use dynamic languages at server side for large scale applications?](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Is-it-good-architectural-decision-2906459.S.265487770)
on LInkedIn.

Some quotes below:

>After developing many web applications in Java/J2EE and tried some more with Groovy/Grails I came up with the following impressions: dynamic languages are great for scripting and even unit testing, but when it comes to develop large, maintainable, easy to evolve modular web applications they fail at server side. Refactoring is a pain, clean code principles are not easy to implement and modularity is not easy to achieve. Tools are also less capable than those designed for strong typed languages such as Java, where refactoring tools are really powerful.

>Hi, it is an interesting topic which you have raised. I think you need the right tool for the job and most of the times you can choose from a large set of tools.
As I see startups and young companies are the ones that embrace the dynamic languages more easily. I think these newer technologies are changing more rapidly then a large application or company could keep up with.
When you start to build a large application you usually plan to use that for years and it is normal if you choose a technology which is more mature.
Many times the given architecture/infrastructure/available licences are limiting the usage of a newer technology.

I totally agree with you, the tools for dynamic languages are not as good as the ones for strong typed languages, but I think this will change rapidly. I'm sure in 1-2 years we will have much better tools than we have now. If you are starting to build a new larger webapp maybe it worth investigating the possibilities which you have. It is not necessary to have all the webapp written using the same technology, as I said before, you have to choose the right tool for the task.
