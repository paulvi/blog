Yeah, now Node.js has a broad choice of tools. Commercial and free, closed and open-source, monolit as WebMatrix or extensible as Eclipse.
Just select what you need. If you have small screen like iPad, there is one choice, if you have 24" screen, then it is better to use it fully.

I have been working with Java and Eclipse for a long while, so I like when I can do all things in one IDE and switch context, just by switching perspective.
And we have Java and Node.js development in one project, so it is nice to adopt the same tool for whole team.
