Hello

My name is Paul Verest  

I am Software [coding] Architect

Interested in Java, Groovy, Scala, Android, Node.js and new Java & JavaScript frameworks; better ways of doing software


Take a look at things that I do:  
[Beijing Software Craftsmanship Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/BeijingSoftwareCraftsmanship/)  
[Eclipse DemoCamps Kepler 2013/Beijing | Eclipse 展示营地 开普勒 2013 北京 ](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Kepler_2013/Beijing)  


I work for [Funshion Online](http://www.funshion.com/english/index.html), Chinese company serving media to 290 000 000 users (60 000 000 daily). 

Open source project I participate:
[npm-proxy aka NPS](https://github.com/funshion/npm-proxy)  
Nodeclipse-1 (Node.js support in Eclipse)  
[Eclipse Node.js IDE (aka Enide)](https://github.com/PaulVI/eclipse-node-ide) which uses Nodeclipse

## Notes   

- Well, [registering](http://forum.springsource.org/register.php) at [SpringSource forum](http://forum.springsource.org/forumdisplay.php)
 is only for brave and determined.
[Try it](http://forum.springsource.org/register.php).

- If you ever wanted to see GitHub issues in Eclipse, since Eclipse 4.2.2 EGit
 comes with [Mylyn GitHub connector](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/GitHub/UserGuide),
so no need to [install](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/github-mylyn-connector),
 just [configure](https://github.com/PaulVI/eclipse-node-ide/blob/master/Hints.md#connect-eclipse-to-github-issues) and use.

- JavaScript type definitions

- I want to organize [Beijing] JVM & Node.js User Groups,
there are maybe more than 100'000 developers in Beijing, but there are no such user groups. That is weird.  
Both are server-side technologies, and my research is about connecting them.
While Java platform has a lot of great things, Node.js beats with re-fresh and simplicity. Welcoming future.

- Eclipse DemoCamp is more about Enterprise software and tooling.  
Hope for intermediate to high level topics.
